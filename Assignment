Create a version of the Game of Sticks where human and AI players can play against each other.

In the Game of Sticks there is a heap of sticks on a board. On their turn, each player picks up 1 to 3 sticks. The one who has to pick the final stick will be the loser.

The following is an example of the game of sticks.

The game starts with 20 sticks on the board.
Marvin takes 3 sticks, there are 17 sticks remaining.
Gunther takes 2 sticks, there are 15 sticks remaining.
Marvin takes 1 stick, there are 14 sticks remaining.
Gunther takes 3 sticks, there are 11 sticks remaining.
Marvin takes 2 sticks, there are 9 sticks remaining.
Gunther takes 2 sticks, there are 7 sticks remaining.
Marvin takes 3 sticks, there are 4 sticks remaining.
Gunther takes 1 stick, there are 3 sticks remaining.
Marvin takes 2 sticks, there is 1 stick remaining.
Gunther has to take the final stick and loses.
This assignment is split into four parts:

Implementing the game as a two-player game.
Adding an AI that can be played against.
Adding an option for training the AI against another AI.
Performing mathematical analysis of the problem based on information gathered from the AI.
Objectives
After completing this assignment, you will...

Understand lists and tuples
Be able to use functions effectively
Be able to build a simple AI

Deliverables
A Git repo named game-of-sticks containing at least:
README.md file explaining how to run your project
An implementation of the game in at least one file named sticks.py.
A suite of tests for your project in at least one file named sticks_test.py.

Normal Mode
Player vs Player
Create a game where two players can play against each other. The two examples below demonstrate how the game behaves.

Example 1:

    Welcome to the Game of Sticks!
    How many sticks are there on the table initially (10-100)? 10

    There are 10 sticks on the board.
    Player 1: How many sticks do you take (1-3)? 3

    There are 7 sticks on the board.
    Player 2: How many sticks do you take (1-3)? 3

    There are 4 sticks on the board.
    Player 1: How many sticks do you take (1-3)? 3

    There is 1 stick on the board.
    Player 2: How many sticks do you take (1-3)? 1
    Player 2, you lose.
